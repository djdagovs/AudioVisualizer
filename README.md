## Javascript Audio Visualization

This simple visualizer hooks into the Soundcloud API in order to allow a user to input any Soundcloud URL to be visualized. By splitting the incoming frequency data into 4 ranges, 4 individual shapes on the screen grow in size, change lightness, and change saturation. The spinning square is 1 such shape, that spins faster the louder the overall frequencies become. When significant beats occur, the color of all 4 shapes change while still maintaining a tetrad color scheme.
